            <h2>SCRUBBER DRYER</h2>
            <p>Peppermintâ€™s robotic scrubber dryer is an intelligent and connected robot. It provides real-time data and analytics with 100% accuracy.  The Peppermint dashboard provides automatic reports with an interface that is easy to customize to your requirements.

                The robotic floor scrubber dryer has 11 levels of safety which include 4 different types of sensors and cameras that integrate with its intuitive MINT-OS to navigate safely and conveniently around the surroundings. It detects human movement and dynamic as well as static obstacles through its intelligent obstacle detection system. The robot comes with dynamic pressure for different types of floors. It cleans with 99.99% harmful bacteria removal and also neutralizes oil on the floor. Its triple-action-clean technology delivers deep and efficient cleaning.</p>

                Material Handling is another most important process today in almost every industrial establishment especially in places like Warehouses and Manufacturing Plants. It is very crucial to handle materials with excellent efficacy to maximize process output and ordered arrangement. There is a dire need to automate this process in order to make it more systematic and efficient. Our continuous advances in machine intelligence and robotics have made it possible for us to fully automate this process for you.
